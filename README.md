# Neural-network-creator
Here is a program called networkCreator, which allows you to draw the network with the mouse, then you press Enter and it generates the source code of the whole network. It generates the source code with tools from a module which can be found here: https://github.com/MuriloMir/neural-network-module.

In order to compile it you just need to download the source code and the "dependencies.zip" file, then extract the dependencies, put everything in the same folder and compile it with the DMD compiler by typing (in the terminal): dmd source -m64 -i -J. -O -g
